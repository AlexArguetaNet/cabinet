# Cabinet
## A simple tool to create new files and folders
Cabinet is a program that can create new files and folders on your computer. It works by taking a path in your file manager and a list of names entered by the user. Files and folders are then created automatically based on this list.. Cabinet is also able to create and write to new text-based files. This offers a simpler way to mass create new files and folders all at once, without having to do so one-by-one in your file manager.
